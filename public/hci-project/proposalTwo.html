      <H2> <b>Proposal 2</b> - <i>What do you think?</i>  </H2><br/>

      <h4>Project Idea</h4>
      If you are having a hard time making a choice and you want to know what your friends think about it, you can use this app
      to do just that. For example, if you cannot choose what dress you want to wear to a party, upload pictures of your top
      choices, share with your friends and leave it to them to decide what suits you the best! You could use the app to get a
      second opinion on literally anything - from cereals to courses to cars.
      The idea behind proposing this app was that people(or students) generally tend to seek validation from others when they
      are confronted with tricky situations. Getting a popular opinion from people helps simplify making a decision. The app
      is designed such that person A can upload multiple pictures/audio/video clips and then adds others , say
      person B and person C to vote. Person B or C can see the question A posted. Even if multiple choices for the question
      are present, they see only two at once. After they choose an option, the rejected one will be replaced by a new one and
      so on until all the options are exhausted. Person B and C add comments supporting their choice as well.
      Person A can now see the popular choice and other votes.<br/><br/>

      <h4>Technologies and Comparison with existing systems</h4>
      <b>Technology</b>  <br/>
      I would like to implement this as a mobile (android) app rather than a website as it will be make it easier to upload pictures,
      audio and video clips as soon as they are captured. <br/>

      <b>Existing Systems</b> <br/>
      1) Instagram, Facebook and Twitter let users add polls to their stories but doesn't let the user choose who to share it with.
      By default it would be shared with everyone who follows you or just a private message to one person which is not ideal if you want
      to limit your question to an intimate group and initiate a discussion to evaluate the options.<br/>
      2) Facebook and Instagram limit the user to type a question and <i>two</i> text choices for it. However this app lets users
      upload <i>multiple</i> pictures/audios and video clips as options to the question.<br/>
      3) This is not a feature that comes with a social networking website but an app in itself that can be used without being
      active on other social media.<br/>
      4) Unlike other polling applications (like PollDaddy , SurveyMonkey etc), the features of this app will be free of cost
      and has the options of comparing audio and video files as well.<br/>

      <b>Key Benefits</b> <br/>
      1) Helps make an well informed decision after evaluation from trusted sources. <br/>
      2) Easy to use and upload images/audios and videos as it is a mobile app. <br/>
      3) Versatile - can be helpful for making any kind of decision (simple or complicated) <br/>
      4) Not just another polling app and free of cost. <br/><br/>
